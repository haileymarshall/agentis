# Setting Up Your GenLayer Validator

Source: https://docs.genlayer.com/validators/setup-guide

Running a GenLayer Validator node ensures the security and reliability of the GenLayer network. Below are the requirements for running a GenLayer validator.

Validators require both a staking deposit and a validator priming transaction to enter the set.

For a deeper understanding of how staking works in GenLayer, see the [Staking documentation](/understand-genlayer-protocol/core-concepts/optimistic-democracy/staking).

## System Requirements

| Resource | Requirement |
|----------|-------------|
| **Memory** | 16 GB RAM |
| **CPU** | 8-core (AMD64 only) |
| **Disk** | 128 GB SSD/NVMe |
| **Network** | 100 Mbps |
| **OS** | 64-bit Linux |
| **Software** | Docker, Python 3 (with pip and venv) |

GPU not required unless running LLMs locally. See [detailed requirements](/validators/system-requirements) for more info.

## Choose Your Setup Method

GenLayer offers two ways to set up your validator node. Both methods result in the same configuration—choose the one that fits your workflow.

| Method | Best For |
|--------|----------|
| **AI-Assisted Setup** | New validators, quick setup, guided troubleshooting |
| **Manual Setup** | Experienced operators, custom configurations, automation pipelines |

### Option 1: AI-Assisted Setup (Recommended)

We've released an interactive AI wizard that guides you through the entire validator setup process step-by-step. Instead of reading through documentation and running commands manually, the wizard handles everything interactively.

#### What it does

- Walks you through all setup steps interactively
- Checks prerequisites automatically (architecture, RAM, Docker, Node.js, Python)
- Detects common issues before they cause problems (port conflicts, disk space, wrong architecture)
- Generates configurations based on your answers
- Supports multiple deployment options: local machine, remote SSH, GCP, AWS, Azure
- Handles both new validators (staking wizard) and existing validators
- Includes minimal-downtime update procedure for upgrades

#### How to use it

1. Install [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) (Anthropic's CLI tool)

2. Add the GenLayer plugin marketplace and install the plugin:
   ```bash
   claude /plugin marketplace add genlayerlabs/skills
   claude /plugin install genlayernode@genlayerlabs
   ```

3. Run the wizard:
   ```bash
   claude /genlayernode install
   ```

That's it. The wizard will ask questions and guide you through everything.

#### Available commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/genlayernode install` | Fresh validator setup |
| `/genlayernode update` | Upgrade existing node |
| `/genlayernode configure grafana` | Set up monitoring |

> **Note:**
  The AI wizard uses the same underlying steps as the manual setup below. You can switch between methods at any point or use the manual guide as a reference.

Browse all available skills at [skills.genlayer.com](https://skills.genlayer.com/) — the marketplace also includes the `genlayer-dev` skill for contract development.

---

### Option 2: Manual Setup

If you prefer to run commands manually, need fine-grained control over each step, or are integrating with existing automation pipelines, follow the detailed instructions in the sections below.

The manual setup covers:
1. **Create the Validator Wallet** — Set up your wallet and stake GEN tokens
2. **Set Up the Validator Node** — Download, configure, and run the node software

---

## Create the Validator Wallet

Before setting up your validator node, you need to create your validator wallet and stake GEN tokens.

### Understanding Validator Addresses

> **Note:**
GenLayer validators use three distinct addresses:

| Address | Description | Where Used |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| **Owner** | The only address that can withdraw staked funds. Keep this secure (cold wallet). | CLI wizard - signs staking transaction |
| **Operator** | Hot wallet on your server that signs blocks. Can be same as owner, but separate is recommended. | Node config: `operatorAddress` |
| **Validator Wallet** | Smart contract created when you join. This is your validator's on-chain identity. | Node config: `validatorWalletAddress` |

The wizard outputs all three addresses at the end. Save them - you'll need the Validator Wallet and Operator addresses for your node configuration.

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v18 or higher)
- **GenLayer CLI** - Install the latest version:
  ```bash
  npm install -g genlayer
  ```
- **GEN tokens** - You need at least **42,000 GEN** for the minimum self-stake requirement

### Using the Validator Wizard

The easiest way to create your validator wallet is using the interactive wizard:

```bash
genlayer staking wizard
```

The wizard guides you through:

1. **Account setup** - Create or select your owner account
2. **Network selection** - Choose testnet-asimov
3. **Balance verification** - Confirms you have at least 42,000 GEN
4. **Operator setup** - Create and export an operator keystore for your validator server
5. **Stake amount** - Enter how much GEN to stake (minimum 42,000)
6. **Validator creation** - Submits the staking transaction
7. **Identity setup** - Set your validator's public profile (moniker, website, etc.)

> **Note:**
  **Save Your Validator Wallet Address!** After the wizard completes, note down your **Validator Wallet** address. You'll need this for your node configuration.

#### Operator Keystore Export

The wizard creates and exports an operator keystore file for you to transfer to your validator server. If your server is compromised, your staked funds (controlled by owner) remain safe.

### Verify Your Validator

After completing the wizard, verify your status:

```bash
genlayer staking validator-info --validator 0xYourValidatorWallet...
```

### Managing Your Validator

```bash
# Add more stake
genlayer staking validator-deposit --amount 1000gen

# Check active validators
genlayer staking active-validators

# Exit (initiates 7-epoch unbonding)
genlayer staking validator-exit --shares 100

# Claim after unbonding period
genlayer staking validator-claim

# Update identity
genlayer staking set-identity --validator 0x... --moniker "New Name"
```

---

## Set Up the Validator Node

Once your validator wallet is created and staked, set up your node software.

### Dependencies

#### LLM Access

Each validator needs access to a Large Language Model (LLM) for executing and evaluating Intelligent Contracts.

It is up to each validator to select the model they want to use.

Possible options:

- Run an open-source model locally on the same machine with a GPU
- Run an open-source model on a different machine
- Connect to a hosted inference provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, Heurist, Atoma network etc.)

See the [GenVM Configuration](/validators/genvm-configuration) page for partner credits, provider setup, and the greybox fallback strategy.

#### ZKSync Full Node for the GenLayer Chain

Each validator needs access to a [ZKSync Full Node](https://docs.zksync.io/zksync-era/tooling/external-node) connected to the GenLayer chain. Validators use this node to read the chain state and submit transactions.

One full node can be shared between multiple validators. The optimal validator-to-node ratio is currently under evaluation.

### Setup

#### Download the node software

1. Select the version of the node you want to run by checking the available builds

   You can use this command to list available versions:

   ```sh
   curl -s "https://storage.googleapis.com/storage/v1/b/gh-af/o?prefix=genlayer-node/bin/amd64" | grep -o '"name": *"[^"]*"' | sed -n 's/.*\/\(v[^/]*\)\/.*/\1/p' | sort -ru | grep -v "rc" | head -n 5
   ```

   You should see a list like this

   ```sh
   v0.5.12
   v0.5.11
   v0.5.10
   v0.5.9
   v0.5.8
   ```

   Typically, you will want to run the latest version

2. Download the packaged application
   ```sh
   export version=v0.5.12 # set your desired version here
   wget https://storage.googleapis.com/gh-af/genlayer-node/bin/amd64/${version}/genlayer-node-linux-amd64-${version}.tar.gz
   ```
3. Extract the node software
   ```sh
   mkdir -p ${version}
   tar -xzvf `genlayer-node-linux-amd64-${version}.tar.gz` -C `./${version}`
   ```
4. Change the directory

   ```sh
   cd `./${version}`
   ```

5. Run Genvm setup

   ```sh
   python3 ./third_party/genvm/bin/setup.py
   ```
It does following:

- Downloads missing runners if any
- Verifies runners hashes
- Sets `elf`/`mach-o` interpreter for all binaries (modules, genvm)
- Rust precompilation for built-in runners

### Configuration

Before you can start up the node, you need to configure it.

#### `config.yaml`

This is the main configuration file of your node. Without it, your node won't start

The file needs to be located at `configs/node/config.yaml`

You can use the following example configuration. **Note:** For most users, you will only need to modify the `genlayerchainrpcurl`, `genlayerchainwebsocketurl`, and the `consensus` section for your target network (see [Network-Specific Consensus Configuration](#network-specific-consensus-configuration) below).

```yaml
# rollup configuration
rollup:
  genlayerchainrpcurl: "TODO: Set your GenLayer Chain ZKSync HTTP RPC URL here" # GenLayer Chain RPC URL
  genlayerchainwebsocketurl: "TODO: Set your GenLayer Chain ZKSync WebSocket RPC URL here" # GenLayer Chain WebSocket URL
  provider: "TODO: Set your GenLayer Chain ZKSync provider" # Rollup operator name; surfaces as the "provider" label on RPC-driven metrics. Set explicitly per deployment.
# consensus contracts configuration
consensus:
  # Testnet - Phase 5
  consensusaddress: "0xe66B434bc83805f380509642429eC8e43AE9874a" # AddressManager Smart Contract Address
  genesis: 17326 # (Optional) Genesis block number for this consensus deployment. If not provided, it will be auto-detected by searching for the first log from the ConsensusMain contract.
  # chain_submit_buffer: "30s" # (Optional) Slack reserved at the end of each consensus step to submit the resulting on-chain tx (commit vote, reveal vote, proposed receipt) before the slot closes. Tune to underlying settlement chain latency. Default 30s.

    # listener instead (Geth-conventional dual-port pattern), set `port`
    # to a value other than 0 and other than rpc.port (e.g. 9152) and
    # set `host` for that listener.

```

#### Network-Specific Consensus Configuration

Set the `consensus` section in your `config.yaml` according to the network you want to join:

##### Testnet Asimov

```yaml
# Asimov Phase 5 network consensus configuration
consensus:
  consensusaddress: "0xe66B434bc83805f380509642429eC8e43AE9874a"
  genesis: 17326

```

##### Testnet Bradbury

```yaml
# Bradbury Phase 1 network consensus configuration
consensus:
  consensusaddress: "0x8aCE036C8C3C5D603dB546b031302FCf149648E8"
  genesis: 501711

```

#### Overriding Configuration with Environment Variables

Any configuration value in `config.yaml` can be overridden using environment variables with the prefix `GENLAYERNODE_`.

**Pattern:**

- Replace dots (`.`) with underscores (`_`)
- Convert to uppercase
- Add the `GENLAYERNODE_` prefix

**Examples:**

| Config Key | Environment Variable |
|------------|---------------------|
| `rollup.genlayerchainrpcurl` | `GENLAYERNODE_ROLLUP_GENLAYERCHAINRPCURL` |
| `rollup.genlayerchainwebsocketurl` | `GENLAYERNODE_ROLLUP_GENLAYERCHAINWEBSOCKETURL` |
| `consensus.contractmainaddress` | `GENLAYERNODE_CONSENSUS_CONTRACTMAINADDRESS` |
| `consensus.contractdataaddress` | `GENLAYERNODE_CONSENSUS_CONTRACTDATAADDRESS` |
| `consensus.genesis` | `GENLAYERNODE_CONSENSUS_GENESIS` |
| `node.mode` | `GENLAYERNODE_NODE_MODE` |
| `node.validatorWalletAddress` | `GENLAYERNODE_NODE_VALIDATORWALLETADDRESS` |
| `node.operatorAddress` | `GENLAYERNODE_NODE_OPERATORADDRESS` |
| `node.rpc.port` | `GENLAYERNODE_NODE_RPC_PORT` |
| `logging.level` | `GENLAYERNODE_LOGGING_LEVEL` |

**Usage example:**

```sh
# Override the RPC port
export GENLAYERNODE_CONSENSUS_CONTRACTMAINADDRESS="0x..."

# Set validator wallet address
export GENLAYERNODE_NODE_VALIDATORWALLETADDRESS="0x..."

# Set logging level
export GENLAYERNODE_LOGGING_LEVEL="DEBUG"
```

Environment variables take precedence over values in `config.yaml`, making them ideal for Docker deployments or sensitive values you don't want in configuration files.

#### GenVM Configuration

See the [GenVM Configuration](/validators/genvm-configuration) page for detailed LLM provider setup, configuration files, and advanced features like greyboxing.

#### Import the Operator Key

The operator key is used by your node to sign blocks and perform validator duties.

#### Option 1: Import from CLI Wizard (Recommended)

If you used `genlayer staking wizard`, it exported an operator keystore file. Transfer this file to your validator server and import it:

```sh
./bin/genlayernode account import \
  --password "your node password" \
  --passphrase "password you set when exporting from wizard" \
  --path "/path/to/operator-keystore.json" \
  -c $(pwd)/configs/node/config.yaml \
  --setup
```

You should see:

```sh
Account imported:
  Address: 0xA0b12Fd2f3F7e86fEC458D114A5E7a6f571160a8
  Account setup as a validator
```

#### Option 2: Generate New Operator Key

You can also generate a new operator key directly on the server:

```sh
./bin/genlayernode account new -c $(pwd)/configs/node/config.yaml --setup --password "your secret password"
```

Then use this address when running the wizard on your local machine.

#### Restoring Your Operator Key

To restore from a backup (e.g., after migrating to a new server):

```sh
./bin/genlayernode account import \
  --password "your node password" \
  --passphrase "your backup encryption passphrase" \
  --path "/path/to/your/secure/backup.key" \
  -c $(pwd)/configs/node/config.yaml \
  --setup
```

> **Note:**
  Always verify that your imported key works by checking the operator address matches what's configured for your validator.

#### Backing Up Your Operator Key

After setting up your operator key, back it up securely:

```sh
./bin/genlayernode account export \
  --password "your node password" \
  --address "your operator address" \
  --passphrase "your backup encryption passphrase" \
  --path "/path/to/your/secure/backup.key" \
  -c $(pwd)/configs/node/config.yaml
```

> **Note:**
  **Important: Back up your operator key!** Losing access means you'll need to set up a new operator and update your validator configuration. Store the backup securely.

To print the private key from your backup file, use the `--print` flag. **Keep this private key secure and never share it.**

### Running the node

Once you have configured everything, you are ready to start the node.

> **Note:**
    **Important:** Before starting the node, ensure you have:
    1. **Operator key** imported into the node (see "Import the Operator Key" above)
    2. **Validator wallet address** - obtained after joining as validator via `genlayer staking wizard` or `validator-join`

    Without both configured, your node will run as a full node instead of a validator.

#### Running the Node using the binary

1.  Set the LLM Provider API Key

    Set the appropriate environment variable for your chosen LLM provider. See the [GenVM Configuration](/validators/genvm-configuration) page for details on LLM providers and obtaining API credits.

    ```sh
    # For Heurist
    export HEURISTKEY='your_heurist_api_key'

    # For Comput3
    export COMPUT3KEY='your_comput3_api_key'

    # For io.net
    export IOINTELLIGENCE_API_KEY='your_ionet_api_key'

    # For Chutes
    export CHUTES_API_KEY='your_chutes_api_key'

    # For Morpheus
    export MORPHEUS_API_KEY='your_morpheus_api_key'

    # For other providers, use the appropriate environment variable name
    ```

2.  Run the WebDriver container

    ```sh
    docker compose up -d # Starts the WebDriver needed by the GenVM web module
    ```

3.  (Optional) Run two services (modules) in background (this is a crucial step for running _Intelligent_ contracts). This can be done automatically or manually.
    - To start them automatically in node configuration set `genvm.manage_modules` to `true`
    - To start them manually run
      ```bash
       ./third_party/genvm/bin/genvm-modules web & ./third_party/genvm/bin/genvm-modules llm &
      ```

> **Note:**
  Note: If you are using the default configuration, `genvm.manage_modules` is
  set to `true` by default, meaning the node will manage these modules
  automatically.

4. Checking Your Configuration

    To ensure your node is correctly configured, you can run the following command:

    ```sh
    ./bin/genlayernode doctor
    ```

    The `doctor` command now includes comprehensive GenVM diagnostics integration to validate:
    - Consensus contract configuration and accessibility
    - GenVM module connectivity and health status
    - LLM provider configuration and API connectivity
    - Network configuration and ZKSync node accessibility

5.  Run the node

    ```sh
    ./bin/genlayernode run -c $(pwd)/configs/node/config.yaml --password "your secret password" # The same password you used when creating the account
    ```

> **Note:**
  If you are running the node via SSH, the process might terminate if your
  connection drops. To prevent this, consider using a terminal multiplexer like
  `screen` or `tmux` to keep the node running in the background even if your SSH
  session ends. You can find a guide on using `screen`
  [here](https://www.networkworld.com/article/967925/how-the-linux-screen-tool-can-save-your-tasks-and-your-sanity-if-ssh-is-interrupted.html).

#### Running the Node using docker-compose

You can also run the GenLayer node using Docker and Docker Compose.

1. Create a `docker-compose.yaml` file with the following content:

```yaml
services:
  webdriver-container:
    container_name: genlayer-node-webdriver
    image: yeagerai/genlayer-genvm-webdriver:0.0.11
    shm_size: 2gb
    security_opt:
      - no-new-privileges:true
    environment:
      PORT: 4444
    ports:
      - "${WEBDRIVER_PORT:-4444}:4444"
    restart: unless-stopped
  genlayer-node:
    image: yeagerai/genlayer-node:${NODE_VERSION:-latest}
    entrypoint: ["sh", "-c", "/app/bin/genlayernode run --password ${NODE_PASSWORD:-12345678}"]
    container_name: genlayer-node
    restart: unless-stopped
    env_file:
      - path: ./.env
        required: false
    ports:
      - "${NODE_RPC_PORT:-9151}:9151"
      - "${NODE_OPS_PORT:-9153}:9153"
    volumes:
      - ${NODE_CONFIG_PATH:-./configs/node/config.yaml}:/app/configs/node/config.yaml:ro
      - ${NODE_DATA_PATH:-./data}:/app/data
      - ./genvm-module-web-docker.yaml:/app/third_party/genvm/config/genvm-module-web.yaml
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro # required for webdriver metrics collection
    security_opt:
      - no-new-privileges:true
    logging:
      driver: "json-file"
      options:
        max-size: "100m"
        max-file: "3"
        compress: "true"
    depends_on:
      - webdriver-container
    profiles:
      - node

```

2. Create `genvm-module-web-docker.yaml` for Docker networking:

The extracted tarball includes `third_party/genvm/config/genvm-module-web.yaml` configured for `localhost`, which works when running
the binary directly. For docker-compose, you need a version that points to the webdriver service name.

Create `genvm-module-web-docker.yaml` in the same directory as your `docker-compose.yaml`:

- Copy the contents of `third_party/genvm/config/genvm-module-web.yaml` into `genvm-module-web-docker.yaml`.
- Modify the `webdriver_host` configuration to use the service name `webdriver-container` instead of `localhost`:

```yaml
webdriver_host: http://webdriver-container:4444
```

This allows the node container to reach the webdriver container using Docker's internal networking.

The key difference:
- **Binary execution**: uses `localhost:4444` (webdriver runs on same machine)
- **Docker-compose**: uses `webdriver-container:4444` (container service name)

3. Set the required environment variables in a `.env` file:

> **Note:**
  This `.env` file serves two purposes: it configures Docker Compose variables (like `NODE_VERSION`, `NODE_PASSWORD`, ports) and can also include `GENLAYERNODE_*` variables to override node configuration values as described in [Overriding Configuration with Environment Variables](#overriding-configuration-with-environment-variables).

```env
# GenLayer Node Release Configuration

# =============================================================================
# WebDriver Configuration (required for GenVM)
# =============================================================================
WEBDRIVER_PORT=4444

# =============================================================================
# Node Service Configuration (optional - use node profile)
# =============================================================================
# Docker image version
NODE_VERSION=v0.4.0

# Keystore password (used to unlock the pre-imported wallet)
NODE_PASSWORD=12345678

# Path to node configuration file
NODE_CONFIG_PATH=./configs/node/config.yaml

# Path to node data directory (for persistence)
NODE_DATA_PATH=./data

# Port mappings
NODE_RPC_PORT=9151
NODE_OPS_PORT=9153

# LLM API Key (required for GenVM LLM module)
HEURISTKEY=
COMPUT3KEY=
IOINTELLIGENCE_API_KEY=
ANTHROPICKEY=
XAIKEY=
GEMINIKEY=
ATOMAKEY=
CHUTES_API_KEY=
MORPHEUS_API_KEY=
```

or simply use the provided `docker-compose.yaml`, `.env.example` and the `genvm-module-web-docker.yaml` from the extracted tarball.

4. Checking Your Configuration

To ensure your node is correctly configured, you can run the following command:

```sh
source .env && docker run --rm --env-file ./.env \
  -v ${NODE_CONFIG_PATH:-./configs/node/config.yaml}:/app/configs/node/config.yaml \
  yeagerai/genlayer-node:${NODE_VERSION:-v0.4.0} \
  ./bin/genlayernode doctor
```

5. Start the services using Docker Compose:

```sh
source .env && docker compose --profile node up -d
```

### Telemetry

For a quick setup using Docker Compose:

1. **Configure your `.env` file** with the required variables for monitoring:

   ```env
   # Central monitoring server endpoints for GenLayer Foundation
   CENTRAL_MONITORING_URL=https://prometheus-prod-66-prod-us-east-3.grafana.net/api/prom/push
   CENTRAL_LOKI_URL=https://logs-prod-042.grafana.net/loki/api/v1/push

   # Authentication for central monitoring
   # Metrics (Prometheus) credentials
   CENTRAL_MONITORING_USERNAME=your-metrics-username
   CENTRAL_MONITORING_PASSWORD=your-metrics-password
   # Logs (Loki) credentials
   CENTRAL_LOKI_USERNAME=your-logs-username
   CENTRAL_LOKI_PASSWORD=your-logs-password

   # Node identification
   NODE_ID=validator-001
   VALIDATOR_NAME=MyValidator
   ```

2. **Run docker compose**:
   ```bash
   docker compose --profile monitoring up -d
   ```

3. **Verify your node is pushing metrics** by checking the [GenLayer Foundation public dashboard](https://genlayerfoundation.grafana.net/public-dashboards/66a372d856ea44e78cf9ac21a344f792)

For detailed monitoring setup including Prometheus metrics, Grafana dashboards, and centralized logging with Alloy, see the [Monitoring Guide](/validators/monitoring).
