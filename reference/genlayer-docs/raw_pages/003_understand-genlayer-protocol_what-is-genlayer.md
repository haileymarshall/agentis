## The Adjudication Layer for the Agentic Economy

GenLayer uses decentralized AI-validator consensus to resolve contracts that require judgment, not just code.

Intelligent Contracts interpret language, process unstructured data, and pull live web inputs. No oracles, no intermediaries.

- **Bitcoin** — Trustless Money
- **Ethereum** — Trustless Computation
- **GenLayer** — Trustless Adjudication

Where Bitcoin reached consensus on the *order* of transactions and Ethereum on the *execution* of code, GenLayer reaches consensus on the **meaning** of transactions. The technical primitive that makes this possible is the [Equivalence Principle](/developers/intelligent-contracts/features/non-determinism): two answers can be different in form yet equivalent in meaning, and a network of independent AI validators can agree on that.

## The Missing Layer

The agentic-commerce stack is being built in the open — and every layer of it stops at the happy path.

| Layer | Standard | What it handles | Dispute resolution |
|---|---|---|---|
| Payments | [x402](https://www.x402.org/) (Coinbase) | Internet-native, agent-friendly payments | Not specified |
| Identity & reputation | [ERC-8004](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-8004) (Ethereum) | Trustless agent identity | Delegated to external validation protocols |
| Agent interoperability | [A2A](https://a2a-protocol.org) (Linux Foundation / Google) | How agents discover each other and exchange tasks | Not defined within the protocol |

Other players are stacking in alongside them — Stripe + OpenAI's ACP (already powering ChatGPT checkout), Visa's Trusted Agent Protocol, Google's AP2, Mastercard's Agent Pay + BVNK, and Tempo (Stripe / Paradigm L1). The shape is the same in every case: the payment goes through, the job is accepted, the reputation is updated — and the moment a single material dispute appears, the stack reaches for a function it does not have.

That function is **adjudication**. Not a sovereign court. A credible, machine-speed mechanism for evaluating contested commitments, weighing evidence, interpreting language, reaching a verdict, and attaching consequences to it.

GenLayer is that layer.

## What Intelligent Contracts Can Do

### Subjective Decisions
Evaluate context and nuance. Turn judgment calls into enforceable on-chain outcomes — content moderation, claim assessment, quality evaluation.

### Internet Access
Fetch live web data directly on-chain. Contracts can read websites, call APIs, and verify real-world information without oracles or intermediaries.

### Natural Language Processing
Interpret human-readable inputs via LLMs. Contracts can analyze text, extract meaning, and make decisions based on qualitative criteria.

### Image & Visual Processing
Pass images to LLMs for analysis — screenshot a webpage and verify its content, check visual evidence for claims, analyze receipts or documents. Contracts can capture screenshots via `gl.nondet.web.render()` and send them to LLMs via `gl.nondet.exec_prompt(images=[...])`.

### Unstructured Data
Process text, images, audio transcripts, and qualitative evidence. Handle real-world complexity that traditional smart contracts cannot.

## How It Compares

| Feature | Traditional Smart Contracts | Intelligent Contracts |
|---|---|---|
| **Language** | Solidity, Rust | Python |
| **Data sources** | On-chain only (or oracles) | On-chain + live web data |
| **Decision logic** | Deterministic only | Deterministic + subjective |
| **AI integration** | Not possible | Native LLM access (text + images) |
| **Consensus** | All nodes must agree on exact output | Validators assess equivalence of results |

## Architecture: Two Layers

GenLayer operates as two integrated layers:

**GenLayer Chain** — an EVM-compatible L2 (zkSync Elastic Chain). Holds account balances via ghost contracts, handles standard Ethereum operations (`eth_*` methods), and anchors to Ethereum's security model.

**GenVM** — the execution environment for Intelligent Contracts. A WebAssembly-based VM (built on [Wasmtime](https://wasmtime.dev)) that runs a Python interpreter with native access to LLMs, web data, and non-deterministic operations. Can also execute compiled native code.

Every Intelligent Contract has a corresponding **ghost contract** on the chain layer at the same address. Ghost contracts hold the contract's GEN balance, relay transactions to consensus, and execute external messages. See [Messages](/developers/intelligent-contracts/features/messages#ghost-contracts) for details.

Transactions enter via `addTransaction` on the chain layer. GenVM executes the contract logic. Results settle back on-chain.

## Develop in Python

Intelligent Contracts are Python classes extending `gl.Contract`:

```python
# { "Depends": "py-genlayer:1jb45aa8ynh2a9c9xn3b7qqh8sm5q93hwfp7jqmwsfhh8jpz09h6" }
from genlayer import *
import json

class WizardOfCoin(gl.Contract):
    has_coin: bool

    def __init__(self):
        self.has_coin = True

    @gl.public.write
    def ask_for_coin(self, request: str) -> None:
        if not self.has_coin:
            raise gl.vm.UserError("I don't have a coin!")

        prompt = f"""
        You are a wizard guarding a gold coin.
        An adventurer says: {request}
        Should you give them the coin?
        Respond as JSON: {{"give_coin": true/false}}
        """

        def leader_fn():
            return gl.nondet.exec_prompt(prompt, response_format="json")

        def validator_fn(leaders_res) -> bool:
            if not isinstance(leaders_res, gl.vm.Return):
                return False
            my_result = leader_fn()
            return my_result["give_coin"] == leaders_res.calldata["give_coin"]

        result = gl.vm.run_nondet_unsafe(leader_fn, validator_fn)
        if result["give_coin"]:
            self.has_coin = False

    @gl.public.view
    def get_has_coin(self) -> bool:
        return self.has_coin
```
