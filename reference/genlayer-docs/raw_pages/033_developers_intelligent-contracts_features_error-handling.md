# Error Handling

Source: https://docs.genlayer.com/developers/intelligent-contracts/features/error-handling

## Unrecoverable Errors

Exit codes terminate execution immediately:

```python
if invalid_condition:
    exit(1)
```

Unhandled exceptions also become unrecoverable:

```python
raise Exception("Critical error")  # Becomes exit(1)
```

## UserError

User-generated errors with UTF-8 encoded messages:

```python
# Can be caught in current sub-vm
raise gl.vm.UserError("Invalid input")

# Immediate user error, more efficient but can't be caught
gl.advanced.user_error_immediate("Insufficient funds")
```

## VMError

VM-generated errors with predefined string codes:

```python
# Non-zero exit codes become VMError
exit(1)  # Results in VMError with specific code

# Resource limit violations also trigger VMError
# (handled automatically by the VM)
```

## Catching UserError

Handle user errors from sub-VMs:

```python
def risky_operation():
    raise gl.vm.UserError("Operation failed")

try:
    result = gl.eq_principle.strict_eq(risky_operation)
except gl.vm.UserError as e:
    print(f"Caught user error: {e.message}")
```

## Error Propagation

Errors flow from non-deterministic to deterministic code:

```python
def nondet_block():
    if some_condition:
        raise gl.vm.UserError("INVALID_STATE")
    return "success"

try:
    gl.eq_principle.strict_eq(nondet_block)
except gl.vm.UserError as e:
    if e.message == "INVALID_STATE":
        # Handle specific error condition
        pass
```

## VM Result Types

GenVM produces four result types:

- **Return** - Successful execution with encoded result
- **VMError** - VM errors (exit codes, resource limits)
- **UserError** - User-generated errors with UTF-8 messages
- **InternalError** - Critical VM failures (not visible to contracts)

## Error Patterns for Consensus

When using `run_nondet_unsafe`, errors affect how validators compare results. If the leader errors, the validator needs to decide: do I agree or disagree?

One approach is to classify errors by their nature, so validators can handle each type appropriately:

- **Deterministic errors** (business logic, client errors): should match exactly between leader and validator
- **Transient errors** (network issues, server errors): both hitting a transient failure is expected
- **LLM errors** (malformed output): disagreeing forces a rotation to a new leader, which is usually what you want

### Example: Error Classification

```python
def validator_fn(leaders_res: gl.vm.Result) -> bool:
    if not isinstance(leaders_res, gl.vm.Return):
        # Leader errored — run the same logic to see if we error too
        leader_msg = leaders_res.message if hasattr(leaders_res, 'message') else ''
        try:
            leader_fn()
            return False  # Leader errored but we succeeded — disagree
        except gl.UserError as e:
            validator_msg = str(e)
            # Both hit the same business logic error — agree
            if validator_msg == leader_msg:
                return True
            return False
        except Exception:
            return False

    # Leader succeeded — validate the result
    validator_result = leader_fn()
    return compare_results(leaders_res.calldata, validator_result)
```

This pattern ensures that consensus failures on broken LLM output or transient network issues lead to retries rather than locking in bad state.
