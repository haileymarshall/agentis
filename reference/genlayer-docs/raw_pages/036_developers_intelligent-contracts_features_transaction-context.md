# Transaction Context

Source: https://docs.genlayer.com/developers/intelligent-contracts/features/transaction-context

Every contract execution has access to information about the transaction that triggered it — caller addresses, value, chain ID, and the transaction **timestamp** (datetime). This page covers how to read the current time, get a Unix timestamp, access caller and tx metadata, and what is *not* exposed (block number, gas, wall-clock).

## `gl.message` — typed accessors

The most common fields are exposed as a typed `NamedTuple`:

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `sender_address` | `Address` | Immediate caller — EOA, EVM contract, or IC depending on how the call was initiated |
| `origin_address` | `Address` | Original transaction submitter — preserved through internal message chains |
| `contract_address` | `Address` | The current contract's own address |
| `value` | `u256` | GEN sent with the call (only in `@gl.public.write.payable` methods) |
| `chain_id` | `u256` | Current chain ID |

```python
@gl.public.write
def deposit(self):
    self.balances[gl.message.sender_address] += gl.message.value
```

For the difference between `sender_address` and `origin_address` across internal message chains, see [Messages](/developers/intelligent-contracts/features/messages).

## `gl.message_raw` — full message dict

`gl.message_raw` is a `TypedDict` with everything the bootloader receives. It includes all `gl.message` fields plus:

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `datetime` | `str` | Transaction datetime as an ISO 8601 string |
| `is_init` | `bool` | `True` iff this execution is a deployment |
| `stack` | `list[Address]` | Stack of view-method callers, excluding the current contract |
| `entry_kind` | `int` | `0` = MAIN, `1` = SANDBOX, `2` = CONSENSUS_STAGE |
| `entry_data` | `bytes` | Raw entry payload |
| `entry_stage_data` | — | Consensus-stage-specific data |

```python
# Detect whether the current execution is a deploy
if gl.message_raw['is_init']:
    self.deployer = gl.message.sender_address
```

> **Note:**
  Prefer `gl.message` for the common fields — it gives you autocompletion and type checking. Reach for `gl.message_raw` only when you need one of the extra fields.

## Time and Timestamps

Time inside the GenVM is **deterministic and pinned to the transaction's timestamp**. Every validator re-executing the transaction sees the same value, so you can use it for storage, comparisons, and prompt context without breaking equivalence.

The Python standard library's clock is wired to the transaction datetime — `datetime.now()`, `datetime.now(tz)`, and `time.time()` all return the same value across validators.

### Transaction Timestamp

The transaction timestamp is exposed three ways. Use whichever fits:

| Form | How | Use for |
|---|---|---|
| Unix seconds | `int(datetime.now(timezone.utc).timestamp())` | Arithmetic, expiries, deltas |
| Unix seconds (alt) | `int(time.time())` | Same — shorter |
| `datetime` object | `datetime.now(timezone.utc)` | Comparisons, formatting |
| ISO 8601 string | `datetime.now(timezone.utc).isoformat()` *or* `gl.message_raw['datetime']` | Storage, audit trails, prompts |

### Common patterns

**Unix timestamp for arithmetic:**

```python
from datetime import datetime, timezone

@gl.public.write
def mint(self):
    now = int(datetime.now(timezone.utc).timestamp())
    self.tokens[gl.message.sender_address] = Token(
        expiry=u256(now + 86400),  # 24h from now
    )
```

**Expiry check:**

```python
@gl.public.view
def is_expired(self, token_id: u256) -> bool:
    now = int(datetime.now(timezone.utc).timestamp())
    return now > int(self.tokens[token_id].expiry)
```

**ISO string for audit trails or events:**

```python
@gl.public.write
def submit(self, payload: str):
    self.submissions.append(Submission(
        sender=gl.message.sender_address,
        payload=payload,
        timestamp=datetime.now(timezone.utc).isoformat(),
    ))
```

**Raw ISO string from the message (skip the clock):**

```python
ts: str = gl.message_raw['datetime']
```

> **Note:**
  The clock returns the **transaction datetime**, not host wall-clock time. Do not call `datetime.now()` expecting current real-world time — by the time validators re-execute, the transaction may be minutes or hours old. Use it for relative arithmetic ("expires 24h after the tx") and timestamping, not for "is it past 5pm right now".

## What is *not* in the context

- **No block number, no block hash.** The transaction context does not carry block-level metadata. If your contract needs block height, fetch it via [Web Access](/developers/intelligent-contracts/features/web-access) against an RPC inside a non-deterministic block.
- **No gas price, no nonce.** Transaction metadata beyond what is listed above is not exposed to the contract.
- **No host wall-clock time.** As above — the clock is the transaction datetime, not the validator's current time.
