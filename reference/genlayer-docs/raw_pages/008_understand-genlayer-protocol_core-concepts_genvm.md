The GenVM is the execution environment for Intelligent Contracts in the GenLayer protocol. It serves as the backbone for processing and managing contract operations within the GenLayer ecosystem.

## Purpose of GenVM

The only purpose of the GenVM is to execute Intelligent Contracts, which can have non-deterministic code while maintaining blockchain security and consistency.

In summary, the GenVM plays a crucial role in enabling GenLayer's unique features, bridging the gap between traditional smart contracts and AI-powered, web-connected Intelligent Contracts.

## Key Features That Make the GenVM Different

Unlike traditional blockchain virtual machines such as Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), the GenVM has some advanced features.

- **Integration with LLMs**: the GenVM facilitates seamless interaction between Intelligent Contracts and Large Language Models
- **Web access**: the GenVM provides access to the Internet
- **User friendliness**: Intelligent Contracts can be written in Python, which makes the learning curve much more shallow

## How the GenVM Works

1. **Contract Deployment**: When an Intelligent Contract is deployed, the GenVM compiles and executes the contract code.

2. **Transaction Processing**: As transactions are submitted to the network, the GenVM executes the relevant contract functions and produces the contract's next state.

## Developer Considerations

When developing Intelligent Contracts for the GenVM:

- Utilize Python's robust libraries and features
- Consider potential non-deterministic outcomes when integrating LLMs
- Implement proper error handling for web data access
- Optimize code for efficient execution within the rollup environment
