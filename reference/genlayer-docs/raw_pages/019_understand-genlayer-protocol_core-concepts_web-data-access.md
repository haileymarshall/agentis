# Web Data Access in Intelligent Contracts

Source: https://docs.genlayer.com/understand-genlayer-protocol/core-concepts/web-data-access

## Overview

GenLayer enables Intelligent Contracts to directly access and interact with web data, removing the need for oracles and allowing for real-time data integration into blockchain applications.

## Key Features

- **Direct Web Access**: Contracts can retrieve data from web sources.
- **Dynamic Applications**: Access to web data allows for applications that respond to external events and real-world data.
- **Equivalence Validation**: Retrieved data is validated across validators to ensure consistency.

## Implementation

1. **Data Retrieval Functions**: GenLayer provides mechanisms for fetching web data within contracts.
2. **Data Parsing and Validation**: Contracts must parse web data and validate it according to defined equivalence criteria.
3. **Security Measures**: Contracts should handle potential security risks such as untrusted data sources and ensure data integrity.

## Considerations

- **Network Dependencies**: Reliance on external web sources introduces dependencies that may affect contract execution.
- **Performance Impact**: Web data retrieval may introduce latency and affect transaction processing times.
