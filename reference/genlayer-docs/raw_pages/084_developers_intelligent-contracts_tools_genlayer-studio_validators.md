# Accessing and Configuring Validators

Source: https://docs.genlayer.com/developers/intelligent-contracts/tools/genlayer-studio/validators

In the GenLayer Studio, validators are essential for achieving consensus and validating transactions through a process known as [Optimistic Democracy](/core-concepts/optimistic-democracy). When you initialize the Studio based on your selected LLM provider(s), you are provided with 5 default validators.

1. **Leaders:** Within this consensus model, one validator is selected as the leader for each transaction. The leader's role is to propose how a transaction should be executed based on the transaction data and the Intelligent Contract's logic.

2. **Validators:** After the leader proposes a transaction execution, other validators are responsible for reviewing and validating the proposal. They use the [Equivalence Principle](/core-concepts/optimistic-democracy/equivalence-principle) to determine if the leader’s proposal meets the required standards.

These validators can be modified to suit your Intelligent Contract's requirements.

## Accessing Validators

To access and manage validators, follow these steps:

1. On the left sidebar, click on the **Validators** icon. This will open the validators page.

2. In the validators page, you will see a list with all the validators currently configured in the Studio along with their models and providers.

## Configuring Validators

To configure validators, you can add new validators or modify existing ones.

1. Click the **New Validator** button to open the validator creation dialog.

2. **Create New Validator:**
   In the validator creation dialog, fill in the required fields:

   - **Provider:** Select the provider for the validator.
   - **Model:** Choose the model that the validator will use.
   - **Stake:** Specify the stake for the validator.
   - **Config:** Enter any additional configuration parameters in JSON format.

3. Click **Create** to add the new validator to your configuration.

## Modify Validator Details

To modify your validator settings, click on any existing validator and modify the fields based on your needs.

## Delete Validator

To delete a validator, click on the delete button beside the validator in the list.

By properly managing and configuring validators, you ensure that your Intelligent Contracts operate smoothly and securely within the GenLayer Studio.
