# Storage Contract

Source: https://docs.genlayer.com/developers/intelligent-contracts/examples/storage

The Storage contract sets up a simple scenario to store and retrieve a string value. This contract demonstrates basic data storage and retrieval functionality within a blockchain environment.

```python
# { "Depends": "py-genlayer:1jb45aa8ynh2a9c9xn3b7qqh8sm5q93hwfp7jqmwsfhh8jpz09h6" }

from genlayer import *

# contract class
class Storage(gl.Contract):
    storage: str

    # constructor
    def __init__(self, initial_storage: str):
        self.storage = initial_storage

    # read methods must be annotated with view
    @gl.public.view
    def get_storage(self) -> str:
        return self.storage

    # write method
    @gl.public.write
    def update_storage(self, new_storage: str) -> None:
        self.storage = new_storage
```

## Code Explanation

- **Initialization**: The `Storage` class initializes the contract with an `initial_storage` value. This value is stored in the `self.storage` attribute.
- **Read Method**: The `get_storage()` method is a read-only function that returns the current value stored in `self.storage`.
- **Write Method**: The `update_storage(new_storage)` method allows updating the stored value with a new string.

## Deploying the Contract

To deploy the Storage contract, you need to initialize the contract state correctly. This setup will determine the initial value stored in the contract.

1. **Set Initial Storage**: Provide the initial storage value. The `initial_storage` constructor parameter is detected from the code. For example, you might set `initial_storage` to "Hello, World!".
2. **Deploy the Contract**: Once the initial storage is set, deploy the contract to make it ready for interaction.

## Checking the Contract State

After deploying the contract, its address is displayed and you can check its state in the **Read Methods** section. Use the `get_storage()` function to see the current value stored in the contract.

## Executing Transactions

To interact with the deployed contract, go to the **Write Methods** section. Here, you can call the `update_storage` method to change the stored value. This triggers the contract's logic to update the storage with the new value.

## Analyzing the Contract's Behavior

When the `update_storage` method is executed:

- The contract updates the `self.storage` attribute with the new value provided.
- You can then use the `get_storage()` method to verify that the value has been updated.

## Handling Different Scenarios

- **Initial State**: When the contract is first deployed, the `get_storage()` method will return the initial value set during deployment.
- **After Update**: After calling `update_storage`, the `get_storage()` method will return the newly set value.
- **Multiple Updates**: You can update the storage multiple times, and each time the most recent value will be stored and returned by `get_storage()`.

You can view the logs to see detailed information about the contract interaction, including the values being stored and retrieved.

This Storage contract provides a simple example of how data can be stored and retrieved on a blockchain, demonstrating basic state management within a smart contract.
