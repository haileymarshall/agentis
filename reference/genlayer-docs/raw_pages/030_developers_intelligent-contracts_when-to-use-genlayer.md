# When to Use GenLayer

Source: https://docs.genlayer.com/developers/intelligent-contracts/when-to-use-genlayer

GenLayer is most useful when your application needs a **shared, on-chain decision** about something a normal deterministic smart contract cannot evaluate by itself.

Use GenLayer when the decision depends on evidence, language, or judgment — and when different parties need to trust the result without relying on a single backend, oracle, or operator.

## Quick Fit Checklist

A feature is usually a good fit for GenLayer if most of these are true:

- **There is a real on-chain consequence**: payout, escrow release, market resolution, reputation update, rule enforcement, or another state change.
- **The outcome requires judgment**: interpreting evidence, applying natural-language rules, evaluating quality, or resolving ambiguity.
- **The evidence can be independently checked**: validators can fetch the same source material or enough comparable evidence to verify the leader's result.
- **The decision benefits from neutral consensus**: counterparties should not have to trust your centralized backend or one AI provider.
- **The result can be made explicit**: your contract can return a structured decision such as `accepted`, `winner`, `score`, `amount`, or `reason`.

If your feature is mostly personalization, summarization, chat, analytics, routing, or UX assistance with no consensus-critical state change, it is usually better handled by a normal backend or frontend LLM.

## Architecture Pattern

A common GenLayer app has three layers:

1. **Frontend or backend**: collects user intent, displays data, handles indexing, and may prepare URLs or evidence.
2. **Intelligent Contract**: owns the consensus-critical decision and any on-chain state transition.
3. **GenLayer validators**: independently verify the leader's result using the evidence and equivalence principle you define.

The key question is:

> What decision must not depend on my server alone?

That decision is the part that belongs in the Intelligent Contract.

## Good Fits

### Prediction or resolution markets

Good fit when the contract resolves a market by checking source evidence and applying listing or resolution rules.

- Frontend: shows the market, lets users trade, links evidence.
- Intelligent Contract: determines the outcome from trusted sources and settles the market.
- Validators: verify that the outcome follows the evidence and rules.

### Dispute or milestone workflows

Good fit when parties agree up front that a contract should evaluate whether a deliverable, task, or condition was satisfied.

- Frontend/backend: stores submissions, attachments, and communication context.
- Intelligent Contract: evaluates the evidence against agreed criteria and releases funds or updates status.
- Validators: verify that the accepted result is reasonable given the evidence.

### Rule or policy verification

Good fit when a decision depends on natural-language criteria.

Examples:

- Does a proposal comply with a DAO constitution?
- Does a submitted work item meet bounty rules?
- Does a listing meet market guidelines?
- Does a claim satisfy policy conditions?

## Weak Fits and Anti-Patterns

### Frontend computes the answer, GenLayer only stores it

If your frontend fetches data, asks an LLM for the answer, and sends the finished result to GenLayer for storage, GenLayer is not adding much trust.

Better pattern: send the contract stable evidence references or inputs, then let the Intelligent Contract perform the consensus-critical evaluation.

### Generic AI brain

If GenLayer is only being used as an AI assistant, recommender, chatbot, or analytics engine, a normal backend is usually simpler and cheaper.

Better pattern: use off-chain AI for UX and exploration, then use GenLayer only for the part where users need neutral settlement or verifiable judgment.

### Private data that validators cannot verify

If validators cannot access enough evidence to independently check the leader result, consensus becomes weak or impossible.

Better pattern: commit to public evidence, signed attestations, hashes, URLs, or other verifiable inputs that validators can inspect.

### Unbounded subjective output

If the contract asks for open-ended text with no structured decision fields, validators may disagree even when they are all reasonable.

Better pattern: return structured fields and compare only the parts that matter. See the [Equivalence Principle](/developers/intelligent-contracts/equivalence-principle).

## What Belongs Where

- **Frontend**: UX, forms, wallets, previews, charts, indexing, user guidance.
- **Backend**: caching, notifications, search, off-chain analytics, non-critical LLM assistance.
- **Intelligent Contract**: the decision that moves money, resolves a market, updates reputation, enforces rules, or creates another shared state transition.
- **Evidence sources**: stable URLs, APIs, signed data, user submissions, or other material validators can fetch or evaluate.

## Dispute Resolution Is Not a Court

GenLayer can support agreed dispute-resolution workflows, but it does not automatically make a decision legally binding or replace a court.

Use safer framing such as:

- evidence-based settlement workflow
- agreed arbitration primitive
- contractual dispute-resolution mechanism
- milestone or deliverable adjudication

Avoid implying that an Intelligent Contract is a legal judge unless your application has the legal agreements, jurisdiction, and review process to support that claim.

## Design Prompt

Before building, answer these questions:

1. What exact decision should GenLayer make?
2. What state changes if the decision is accepted?
3. What evidence will validators use to verify it?
4. Which fields must validators agree on exactly, and which can vary?
5. What happens if validators reject the leader result or the transaction becomes undetermined?

If the answers are clear, the feature is probably a good candidate for GenLayer. If not, start by moving more logic off-chain or narrowing the on-chain decision.
