# GenLayer Project Boilerplate

Source: https://docs.genlayer.com/developers/decentralized-applications/project-boilerplate

The GenLayer Project Boilerplate is a template for building decentralized applications (DApps) on GenLayer. This boilerplate includes a complete example implementation of a football prediction market, demonstrating best practices and common patterns for GenLayer development.

> **Note:**
    This boilerplate is a work in progress and is not yet ready for production use. You can find the latest version at: [GenLayer Project Boilerplate](https://github.com/genlayerlabs/genlayer-project-boilerplate)

## Features

- **Contract Templates**: Ready-to-use intelligent contract templates and examples
- **Testing Framework**: Built-in testing infrastructure for end-to-end testing
- **Frontend Integration**: Vue.js-based frontend setup with GenLayerJS integration
- **Environment Configuration**: Pre-configured environment setup for development
- **Example Implementation**: Full football prediction market implementation

## How it's Built

The boilerplate project is structured to provide a development environment for GenLayer applications, combining both backend contract development and frontend user interface.

### Technologies Used

- **Python**: For intelligent contract development and testing
- **Vue.js**: Frontend framework for building user interfaces
- **GenLayerJS**: SDK for interacting with GenLayer contracts
- **pytest**: Testing framework for contract validation
- **Vite**: Frontend build tool and development server

## Requirements

Before using the GenLayer Project Boilerplate, ensure your system meets the following requirements:

- **GenLayer Studio**: Running instance required
- **Node.js**: Version 18.x or higher
- **Python**: Version 3.8 or higher

### Installation

1. Clone the boilerplate repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/genlayerlabs/genlayer-project-boilerplate
cd genlayer-project-boilerplate
```

2. Set up the environment:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

## Usage

### Deploying Contracts

1. Access the GenLayer Simulator UI (default: http://localhost:8080)
2. Navigate to "Contracts" section
3. Create a new contract using `/contracts/football_prediction_market.py`
4. Deploy through the "Run and Debug" interface

### Frontend Setup

1. Configure the frontend environment:
```bash
cd app
cp .env.example .env
# Add your contract address to VITE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS
```

2. Install dependencies and start the development server:
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Running Tests

Execute the test suite using pytest:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pytest test
```

## Football Prediction Market Example

The included example contract demonstrates a complete prediction market implementation with the following features:

### Contract Functions

#### Create Predictions:
  ```python
  create_prediction(game_date: str, team1: str, team2: str, predicted_winner: str)
  ```

#### Resolve Predictions:
  ```python
  resolve_prediction(prediction_id: str)
  ```

#### Query Data:
  ```python
  get_player_predictions(player_address: str)
  get_player_points(player_address: str)
  ```

### Frontend Integration

The Vue.js frontend demonstrates:
- Wallet connection handling
- Contract interaction using GenLayerJS
- User interface for prediction creation and management
- Real-time updates for prediction status

## Testing Framework

The boilerplate includes a comprehensive testing suite covering the following scenarios:

### Contract Schema
The schema of the contract is well generated and has the expected methods and variables.

### Test Scenarios

#### Successful Draw Prediction
Tests the scenario where a player correctly predicts a draw between two teams. When the match is resolved as a draw, the player should receive 1 point for their accurate prediction.

#### Successful Winner Prediction
Validates the case where a player correctly predicts the winning team. Upon match resolution confirming their predicted team as the winner, the player should be awarded 1 point.

#### Unsuccessful Prediction
Covers the scenario where a player's prediction doesn't match the actual result. This could be:
- Predicting Team A wins, but Team B wins
- Predicting a draw, but there's a winner
- Predicting a winner, but the match ends in a draw
In all these cases, the player should receive 0 points.

## Best Practices

- Always use environment variables for configuration
- Implement comprehensive testing for all contract functions
- Follow the provided folder structure for consistency
- Use TypeScript for frontend development
- Implement proper error handling in both contract and frontend code
