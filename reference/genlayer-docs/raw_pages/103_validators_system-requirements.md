# System Requirements

Source: https://docs.genlayer.com/validators/system-requirements

Below are the **initial** recommended system requirements for running a GenLayer validator node. These guidelines may change as the network grows and evolves.

## RAM

- **Recommended:** 16 GB
- **Why:**
  - GenLayer's _genvm_ can spawn multiple Sub-VMs for contract calls and non-deterministic blocks.
  - Each Sub-VM can consume up to ~4 GB of RAM for storage.

## CPU

- **Recommended:** Modern multi-core processor with at least 8 cores/16 threads

## Architecture

- **Recommended:** `AMD64`
- `ARM64` is not supported at this time

## Storage

- **Recommended Disk Space:** 128 GB+
- **Preferred Type:** SSD or NVMe (M.2)

## Network

- 100 Mbps connection
- **Recommended:**: 1 Gbps+

## GPU (Optional)

- GPU is **Not Required**
- If you want to run LLMs locally, you will need to select appropriate hardware (typically a CUDA-compatible GPU with sufficient VRAM for the model you intend to use)

> **Note:**
  These requirements are a starting point. As GenLayer evolves and usage
  patterns change (e.g., more complex AI-driven Intelligent Contracts), the
  recommended hardware may change.

## Software

- Operating System - 64-bit Linux (Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS, etc.)
- `docker` - for running the WebDriver container
- `python3`, `python3-pip` and `python3-venv` for GenVM setup
