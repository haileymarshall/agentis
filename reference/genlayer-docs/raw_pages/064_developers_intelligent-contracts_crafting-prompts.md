# Prompt & Data Techniques

Source: https://docs.genlayer.com/developers/intelligent-contracts/crafting-prompts

Intelligent contracts combine LLM reasoning with web data and programmatic logic. Getting reliable results requires specific techniques — structured outputs, stable data extraction, and grounding LLM judgments with verified facts.

## Always Return JSON

The single most impactful technique. Using `response_format="json"` guarantees the LLM returns parseable JSON, eliminating manual cleanup:

```python
def leader_fn():
    prompt = f"""
    You are a wizard guarding a magical coin.
    An adventurer says: {request}

    Should you give them the coin? Respond as JSON:
    {{"reasoning": "your reasoning", "give_coin": true/false}}
    """
    return gl.nondet.exec_prompt(prompt, response_format="json")

def validator_fn(leaders_res) -> bool:
    if not isinstance(leaders_res, gl.vm.Return):
        return False
    my_result = leader_fn()
    # Compare the decision, not the reasoning
    return my_result["give_coin"] == leaders_res.calldata["give_coin"]

result = gl.vm.run_nondet_unsafe(leader_fn, validator_fn)
```

Without `response_format="json"`, LLMs may wrap output in markdown code fences, add commentary, or return malformed JSON. With it, you get a parsed dict directly.

> **Note:**
    Always define the JSON schema in your prompt. `response_format="json"` ensures valid JSON, but the LLM still needs to know *which* fields to include.

## Extract Stable Fields from Web Data

When fetching external data for consensus, the leader and validators make **independent requests**. API responses often contain fields that change between calls — timestamps, view counts, caching headers. Extract only the fields that matter:

```python
def leader_fn():
    response = gl.nondet.web.get(github_api_url)
    data = json.loads(response.body.decode("utf-8"))
    # Only return fields that are stable across requests
    return {
        "id": data["id"],
        "title": data["title"],
        "state": data["state"],
        "merged": data.get("merged", False),
    }
    # NOT: updated_at, comments, reactions, changed_files

def validator_fn(leaders_res) -> bool:
    if not isinstance(leaders_res, gl.vm.Return):
        return False
    return leader_fn() == leaders_res.calldata
```

This is the #1 cause of failed consensus for new developers. If your contract fetches web data and consensus keeps failing, check whether you're returning unstable fields.

## Compare Derived Status, Not Raw Data

Sometimes even stable fields can differ between calls — a new CI check run starts, a comment is added. Instead of comparing raw arrays, derive a summary and compare that:

```python
def _check_ci_status(self, repo: str, commit_hash: str) -> str:
    url = f"https://api.github.com/repos/{repo}/commits/{commit_hash}/check-runs"

    def leader_fn():
        response = gl.nondet.web.get(url)
        data = json.loads(response.body.decode("utf-8"))
        return [
            {"name": c["name"], "status": c["status"], "conclusion": c.get("conclusion", "")}
            for c in data.get("check_runs", [])
        ]

    def validator_fn(leaders_res) -> bool:
        if not isinstance(leaders_res, gl.vm.Return):
            return False
        validator_result = leader_fn()

        # Compare derived status, not raw arrays
        # (check count may differ if new CI run triggered between calls)
        def derive_status(checks):
            if not checks:
                return "pending"
            for c in checks:
                if c.get("status") != "completed":
                    return "pending"
                if c.get("conclusion") != "success":
                    return c.get("conclusion", "failure")
            return "success"

        return derive_status(leaders_res.calldata) == derive_status(validator_result)

    checks = gl.vm.run_nondet(leader_fn, validator_fn)

    if not checks:
        return "pending"
    for c in checks:
        if c.get("conclusion") != "success":
            return c.get("conclusion", "failure")
    return "success"
```

The key insight: consensus doesn't require identical data — it requires agreement on the **decision**.

## Ground LLM Judgments with Programmatic Facts

LLMs hallucinate on character-level checks. Ask "does this text contain an em dash?" and the LLM may say yes when it doesn't, or vice versa. The fix: check programmatically first, then feed the results as ground truth into the LLM prompt.

### Step 1: LLM Generates Checkable Rules

Ask the LLM to convert human-readable rules into Python expressions:

```python
def _generate_rule_checks(self, rules: str) -> list:
    prompt = f"""Given these rules, generate Python expressions that can
    programmatically verify each rule that CAN be checked with code.
    Variable `text` contains the post text. Skip subjective rules.

    Rules:
    {rules}

    Output JSON: {{"checks": [{{"rule": "...", "expression": "...", "description": "..."}}]}}"""

    return gl.nondet.exec_prompt(prompt, response_format="json").get("checks", [])

# Example output for rules "no em dashes, must mention @BOTCHA, must include botcha.xyz":
# [
#   {"rule": "no em dashes",    "expression": "'—' not in text",      ...},
#   {"rule": "mention @BOTCHA", "expression": "'@BOTCHA' in text",    ...},
#   {"rule": "include link",    "expression": "'botcha.xyz' in text", ...},
# ]
```

### Step 2: Eval in a Sandbox

Run the generated expressions deterministically — no hallucination possible:

```python
def _eval_rule_checks(self, checks: list, tweet_text: str) -> list:
    def run_checks():
        results = []
        for check in checks:
            try:
                passed = eval(
                    check["expression"],
                    {"__builtins__": {"len": len}, "text": tweet_text},
                )
                results.append({
                    "rule": check["rule"],
                    "result": "SATISFIED" if passed else "VIOLATED",
                })
            except Exception:
                pass  # skip broken expressions, let LLM handle the rule
        return results

    return gl.vm.unpack_result(gl.vm.spawn_sandbox(run_checks))
```

> **Note:**
    `gl.vm.spawn_sandbox` runs a function in an isolated sandbox within the GenVM. `gl.vm.unpack_result` extracts the return value. Together they let you execute dynamically generated code safely. See the [genlayer-py API reference](/api-references/genlayer-py) for details.

### Step 3: Inject Ground Truth into LLM Prompt

Feed the verified results back so the LLM focuses on subjective rules and doesn't override programmatic facts:

```python
compliance_prompt = f"""
Evaluate this submission for compliance with the campaign rules.

Submission: {tweet_text}

IMPORTANT — PROGRAMMATIC VERIFICATION RESULTS:
These results are GROUND TRUTH from running code on the raw text.
Do NOT override them with your own character-level analysis.

<programmatic_checks>
{chr(10).join(f"- {r['rule']}: {r['result']}" for r in programmatic_results)}
</programmatic_checks>

For rules NOT listed above, use your own judgment.

Respond as JSON: {{"compliant": true/false, "violations": ["..."]}}
"""

result = gl.nondet.exec_prompt(compliance_prompt, response_format="json")
```

This three-step pattern — **generate checks → eval deterministically → inject as ground truth** — eliminates an entire class of LLM errors. Use it whenever your contract needs to verify concrete, checkable facts.

## Classify Errors

Use error prefixes to distinguish user mistakes from infrastructure failures. This helps both debugging and error handling logic:

```python
ERROR_EXPECTED = "[EXPECTED]"    # Business logic errors (deterministic)
ERROR_EXTERNAL = "[EXTERNAL]"   # API/network failures (non-deterministic)

# In contract methods:
if sender != bounty.owner:
    raise ValueError(f"{ERROR_EXPECTED} Only bounty owner can validate")

if response.status != 200:
    raise ValueError(f"{ERROR_EXTERNAL} GitHub API returned {response.status}")
```

`[EXPECTED]` errors mean the transaction should fail consistently across all nodes. `[EXTERNAL]` errors mean the external service had a problem — the transaction may succeed on retry.
