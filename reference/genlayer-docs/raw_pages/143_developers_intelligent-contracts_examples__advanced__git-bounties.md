# GitBounties Contract

Source: https://docs.genlayer.com/developers/intelligent-contracts/examples/_advanced/_git-bounties

The GitBounties contract sets up a scenario to manage bounties for GitHub issues, allowing developers to claim points for resolving issues. This contract demonstrates more complex interactions involving external data (GitHub) and multi-step processes within a blockchain environment.

This intelligent contract is currently not migrated to the real GenVM syntaxis.

## Code Explanation

- **Initialization**: The `GitBounties` class initializes the contract with a GitHub repository, setting up data structures for developers, points, and bounties.
- **Read Methods**:
  - `get_developers()`: Returns the mapping of GitHub usernames to blockchain addresses.
  - `get_points()`: Returns the mapping of GitHub usernames to earned points.
  - `get_bounties()`: Returns the current bounties and their status.
- **Write Methods**:
  - `add_bounty(issue, points)`: Allows the owner to add a new bounty for an issue.
  - `register(github_username)`: Allows developers to register by linking their GitHub profile to their blockchain address.
  - `claim(pull)`: Processes a claim for a resolved issue, awarding points based on the bounty and the number of change requests asked by reviewers.

## Deploying the Contract

To deploy the GitBounties contract, you need to provide the GitHub repository:

1. **Set GitHub Repository**: Provide the GitHub repository in the format "username/repository".
2. **Deploy the Contract**: Once the repository is set, deploy the contract to make it ready for interaction.

## Checking the Contract State

After deploying the contract, its address is displayed and you can check its state in the **Read Methods** section.

- Use `get_developers()` to see registered developers.
- Use `get_points()` to see points earned by developers.
- Use `get_bounties()` to see all current bounties and their status.

## Executing Transactions

To interact with the deployed contract, go to the **Write Methods** section. Here, you can:

- Call `add_bounty(issue, points)` to create a new bounty (owner only).
- Call `register(github_username)` for developers to register.
- Call `claim(pull)` to process a claim for a resolved issue.

## Analyzing the Contract's Behavior

The contract's behavior involves several complex interactions:

- **Adding Bounties**: Only the contract owner can add bounties for specific issues.
- **Developer Registration**: Developers must register by providing their GitHub username. The contract verifies that their address has been added to their GitHub profile.
- **Claiming Bounties**: When a developer claims a bounty:
  - The contract fetches the pull request data from GitHub.
  - It verifies if the pull request is merged and identifies the associated issue.
  - It calculates points based on the bounty value and the number of change requests.
  - Points are awarded to the developer who resolved the issue.

## Handling Different Scenarios

- **Successful Claim**: When a valid claim is processed, the bounty is marked as claimed, and points are awarded to the developer.
- **Invalid Claim**: If the pull request is not merged or doesn't reference a valid bounty, the claim is rejected.
- **Point Calculation**: The number of change requests affects the points awarded, with more changes resulting in fewer points.
- **Minimum Points**: A minimum of 1 point is always awarded for a successful claim.

This GitBounties contract demonstrates a complex use case involving external data integration, multi-step verification processes, and dynamic point calculation. It showcases how blockchain contracts can interact with real-world systems to create incentive structures for open-source contributions.
