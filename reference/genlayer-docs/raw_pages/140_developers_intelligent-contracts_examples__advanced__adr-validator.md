# ADRValidator Contract

Source: https://docs.genlayer.com/developers/intelligent-contracts/examples/_advanced/_adr-validator

The ADRValidator contract sets up a system for validating, categorizing, and ensuring consistency of Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) in a decentralized and automated manner. This contract demonstrates complex document validation, category management, and a reward system within a blockchain environment.

This intelligent contract is currently not migrated to the real GenVM syntaxis.

## Code Explanation

- **Initialization**: The `ADRValidator` class initializes with an owner, empty categories and balances, and a default max reward.
- **Key Methods**:

  - `validate_adr()`: Validates an ADR's structure and content, and rewards the submitter if accepted.
  - `_check_template()`: Uses regex to ensure the ADR follows a specific structure.
  - `_evaluate_adr()`: Uses an LLM to check for contradictions with existing ADRs and determine acceptance and reward.
- **Management Methods**:
  Methods for changing owner, setting max reward, and managing categories.
- **Read Methods**:
  Various getter methods to retrieve contract state, categories, and balances.

## Deploying the Contract

To deploy the ADRValidator contract:

1. **Deploy the Contract**: No initial parameters are needed. The deployer becomes the initial owner.

## Checking the Contract State

After deploying the contract, you can check its state in the Read Methods section:

- Use `get_owner()` to see the current contract owner.
- Use `get_categories()` to view defined architectural categories.
- Use `get_balances()` to check reward balances of contributors.

## Executing Transactions

To interact with the deployed contract, go to the Write Methods section. Here, you can:

- Call `add_category(name, description)` to define new architectural categories (owner only).
- Call `validate_adr(adr, category_name)` to submit an ADR for validation.
- Call `change_owner(new_owner)` or `set_max_reward(new_max_reward)` for contract management (owner only).

## Analyzing the Contract's Behavior

The contract's behavior involves several complex processes:

1. **Template Validation**: Uses regex to ensure ADRs follow a specific structure.
2. **Consistency Checking**: Employs an LLM to compare new ADRs against existing ones for contradictions.
3. **Automated Decision-Making**: Determines acceptance and reward based on LLM evaluation.
4. **Reward System**: Automatically credits submitters with tokens for accepted ADRs.

## Handling Different Scenarios

As illustrated in the provided flowchart:

![ADRValidator Flowchart](/_next/image?url=%2Fcontract-examples%2Fadr-validator%2Fflowchart.png&w=1920&q=75)

- **Invalid ADR Structure**: The ADR is rejected without further evaluation.
- **Valid ADR, Contradictions Found**: The ADR is rejected with reasoning provided.
- **Valid ADR, No Contradictions**: The ADR is accepted, and the submitter is rewarded.

The outputs shows various scenarios:

![ADRValidator Outputs](/_next/image?url=%2Fcontract-examples%2Fadr-validator%2Foutputs.png&w=1920&q=75)

This diagram illustrates different outcomes based on the ADR's content and its relation to existing ADRs in the category.

## Use Cases and Market Potential

The ADRValidator contract has broad applications:

- **Software Development Teams**: For managing and validating architectural decisions.
- **Resource Allocation**: In contexts where decisions about shared resources (e.g., budget, design principles) are critical.
- **Hackathons and Competitions**: As a tool for evaluating and rewarding contributions.

Its automated, trustless nature makes it valuable for any organization seeking to streamline decision-making processes and ensure consistency in architectural choices.

## Future Enhancements

Future developments may include:

1. **Spam Prevention**: Implementing measures to prevent submission of fake or spammy ADRs.
2. **Platform Integration**: Direct integration with platforms like GitHub for seamless ADR management.
3. **Global ADR Repository**: Evolving into a comprehensive, accessible repository for ADRs worldwide.

This ADRValidator contract demonstrates an innovative use of GenLayer for document validation and decision-making in software architecture. It showcases how Intelligent Contracts can automate complex processes, ensure consistency, and provide incentives for quality contributions in a decentralized manner.
