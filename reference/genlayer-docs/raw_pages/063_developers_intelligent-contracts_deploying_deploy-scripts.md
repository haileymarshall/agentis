# Deploy Scripts

Source: https://docs.genlayer.com/developers/intelligent-contracts/deploying/deploy-scripts

For more complex deployment workflows, use deploy scripts.

## Script Structure

Create TypeScript or JavaScript files in the `deploy/` directory:

```
your-project/
├── deploy/
│   ├── 001_deploy_main_contract.ts
│   ├── 002_setup_configuration.ts
│   └── 003_initialize_data.ts
└── contracts/
    └── my_contract.py
```

> **Note:**
  Deploy scripts are executed in alphabetical order. Use numeric prefixes (001_, 002_) to control execution order.

## Basic Deploy Script

Here's a template for a deploy script (`deploy/deployScript.ts`):

```typescript
import { readFileSync } from "fs";
import path from "path";
import {
  TransactionHash,
  TransactionStatus,
  GenLayerClient,
  DecodedDeployData,
  GenLayerChain
} from "genlayer-js/types";
import { testnetBradbury } from "genlayer-js/chains";

export default async function main(client: GenLayerClient<any>) {
  // Read the contract file
  const filePath = path.resolve(process.cwd(), "contracts/my_contract.py");
  const contractCode = new Uint8Array(readFileSync(filePath));

  // Initialize consensus
  await client.initializeConsensusSmartContract();

  // Deploy the contract
  const deployTransaction = await client.deployContract({
    code: contractCode,
    args: [], // Constructor arguments
  });

  // Wait for deployment confirmation
  const receipt = await client.waitForTransactionReceipt({
    hash: deployTransaction as TransactionHash,
    retries: 200,
  });

  // Check deployment success
  if (
    receipt.statusName !== TransactionStatus.ACCEPTED &&
    receipt.statusName !== TransactionStatus.FINALIZED
  ) {
    throw new Error(`Deployment failed. Receipt: ${JSON.stringify(receipt)}`);
  }

  // Receipt structure differs between testnet and localnet/studionet
  const deployedContractAddress =
    (client.chain as GenLayerChain).id !== testnetBradbury.id
      ? receipt.data.contract_address
      : (receipt.txDataDecoded as DecodedDeployData)?.contractAddress;

  console.log("Contract deployed successfully!", {
    "Transaction Hash": deployTransaction,
    "Contract Address": deployedContractAddress,
  });

  return deployedContractAddress;
}
```

## Advanced Deploy Script with Configuration

```typescript
import { readFileSync } from "fs";
import path from "path";
import {
  TransactionHash,
  TransactionStatus,
  GenLayerClient,
  DecodedDeployData,
  GenLayerChain
} from "genlayer-js/types";
import { testnetBradbury } from "genlayer-js/chains";

export default async function main(client: GenLayerClient<any>) {
  console.log("🚀 Starting deployment process...");

  // Deploy main contract
  const mainContractAddress = await deployContract(
    client,
    "contracts/main_contract.py",
    ["Initial Config", 1000]
  );

  // Deploy helper contract
  const helperContractAddress = await deployContract(
    client,
    "contracts/helper_contract.py",
    [mainContractAddress]
  );

  // Configure the main contract
  await configureContract(client, mainContractAddress, helperContractAddress);

  console.log("✅ Deployment completed successfully!");
  console.log({
    mainContract: mainContractAddress,
    helperContract: helperContractAddress,
  });
}

async function deployContract(
  client: GenLayerClient<any>,
  contractPath: string,
  args: any[] = []
): Promise<string> {
  const filePath = path.resolve(process.cwd(), contractPath);
  const contractCode = new Uint8Array(readFileSync(filePath));

  await client.initializeConsensusSmartContract();

  const deployTransaction = await client.deployContract({
    code: contractCode,
    args,
  });

  const receipt = await client.waitForTransactionReceipt({
    hash: deployTransaction as TransactionHash,
    retries: 200,
  });

  // Check deployment success
  if (
    receipt.statusName !== TransactionStatus.ACCEPTED &&
    receipt.statusName !== TransactionStatus.FINALIZED
  ) {
    throw new Error(`Deployment failed for ${contractPath}. Receipt: ${JSON.stringify(receipt)}`);
  }

  // Receipt structure differs between testnet and localnet/studionet
  const deployedContractAddress =
    (client.chain as GenLayerChain).id !== testnetBradbury.id
      ? receipt.data.contract_address
      : (receipt.txDataDecoded as DecodedDeployData)?.contractAddress;

  return deployedContractAddress;
}

async function configureContract(
  client: GenLayerClient<any>,
  mainAddress: string,
  helperAddress: string
) {
  // Example configuration call
  const hash = await client.writeContract({
    address: mainAddress as any,
    functionName: "setHelperContract",
    args: [helperAddress],
    value: 0n,
  });

  await client.waitForTransactionReceipt({
    hash,
    retries: 100,
    interval: 5000,
  });
}
```

## Running Deploy Scripts

Execute all deploy scripts in order:

```bash
genlayer deploy
```

The CLI will automatically:
1. Find all `.ts` and `.js` files in the `deploy/` directory
2. Sort them numerically by filename prefix (001_, 002_, etc.)
3. Execute them in order
4. Pass a configured GenLayer client to each script

## Script Organization

### Recommended File Naming

```
deploy/
├── 001_core_contracts.ts      # Core infrastructure
├── 002_token_contracts.ts     # Token-related contracts
├── 003_governance.ts          # Governance setup
├── 004_configure_system.ts    # System configuration
└── 999_verify_deployment.ts   # Post-deployment verification
```

## Error Handling

Always include proper error handling in deploy scripts:

```typescript
export default async function main(client: GenLayerClient<any>) {
  try {
    await client.initializeConsensusSmartContract();

    const deployTransaction = await client.deployContract({
      code: contractCode,
      args: [],
    });

    const receipt = await client.waitForTransactionReceipt({
      hash: deployTransaction as TransactionHash,
      retries: 200,
    });

    // Check deployment success
    if (
      receipt.statusName !== TransactionStatus.ACCEPTED &&
      receipt.statusName !== TransactionStatus.FINALIZED
    ) {
      throw new Error(`Deployment failed: ${JSON.stringify(receipt)}`);
    }

    // Receipt structure differs between testnet and localnet/studionet
    const deployedContractAddress =
      (client.chain as GenLayerChain).id !== testnetBradbury.id
        ? receipt.data.contract_address
        : (receipt.txDataDecoded as DecodedDeployData)?.contractAddress;

    return deployedContractAddress;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Deployment failed:", error);
    throw error;
  }
}
```
