# Flight Insurance Contract

Source: https://docs.genlayer.com/developers/intelligent-contracts/examples/_advanced/_flight-insurance

The Flight Insurance contract sets up a scenario for managing flight delay insurance. It allows passengers to buy insurance for specific flights and automatically processes claims based on flight status information from an independent source. This contract demonstrates complex real-world interactions, external data integration, and automated claim processing within a blockchain environment.

# Flight Insurance Intelligent Contract is a contract that allows passengers to buy insurance for their flights.
# The contract is created by the insurance manager for specific flight 
# and the passengers can buy insurance for this specific flight.
# The contract has a method to check the flight status from an independent source of information
# and a method to claim the insurance in case the flight is delayed.
# The payment is done by the insurance manager to the passengers in case the flight is delayed.
# Passenger does not need to trust on the insurance manager to get the payment.

## Code Explanation

- **Initialization**: The FlightInsurance class initializes the contract with specific flight details, insurance parameters, and initial balances.
- **Key Methods**:
  - `ask_for_flight_status()`: Checks the flight status from an external source (FlightAware) using an LLM to interpret the data.
  - `add_passenger()`: Adds a new passenger to the insurance contract.
  - `insurance_claim()`: Processes insurance claims for passengers if the flight is delayed.
- **Read Methods**: Various getter methods to retrieve flight details, insurance parameters, and balances.

## Deploying the Contract

To deploy the Flight Insurance contract, you need to provide the flight details and insurance parameters:

1. **Set Flight Details**: Provide flight number, date, time, origin, and destination.
2. **Set Insurance Parameters**: Specify the number of insured passengers and the insurance value per passenger.
3. **Deploy the Contract**: Once all parameters are set, deploy the contract to start the insurance coverage.

## Checking the Contract State

After deploying the contract, its address is displayed and you can check its state in the **Read Methods** section.

- Use `get_flight_status()` to see if the flight is delayed.
- Use `get_insurance_balance(address)` to check a passenger's insurance balance.
- Use other getter methods to retrieve various contract details.

## Executing Transactions

To interact with the deployed contract, go to the **Write Methods** section. Here, you can:

- Call `ask_for_flight_status()` to update the flight status from the external source.
- Call `add_passenger(address)` to add a new insured passenger.
- Call `insurance_claim(address)` for a passenger to claim their insurance if the flight is delayed.

## Analyzing the Contract's Behavior

The contract's behavior involves several complex interactions:

- **External Data Integration**: The contract uses an LLM to interpret flight status data from FlightAware, an external source.
- **Automated Claim Processing**: If a flight is determined to be delayed, the contract automatically processes claims for insured passengers.
- **Balance Management**: The contract manages balances for both the insurance manager and insured passengers, automatically transferring funds when claims are processed.

## Handling Different Scenarios

- **Flight On Time**: If the flight is on time, no claims are processed, and balances remain unchanged.
- **Flight Delayed**: If the flight is delayed, insured passengers can claim their insurance, and funds are automatically transferred from the insurance manager's balance to the passengers'.
- **Multiple Claims**: The contract ensures that each passenger can only claim once, preventing double-dipping.
- **New Passengers**: The contract allows adding new passengers, expanding the pool of insured individuals.

This Flight Insurance contract demonstrates a practical use case for blockchain technology in the insurance industry. It showcases how smart contracts can automate complex processes, integrate external data sources, and provide transparent, trustless insurance services. The use of an LLM to interpret external data adds an innovative layer of intelligence to the contract's decision-making process.
