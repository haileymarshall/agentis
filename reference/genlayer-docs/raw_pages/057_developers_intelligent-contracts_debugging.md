# Debugging Intelligent Contracts on GenLayer

Source: https://docs.genlayer.com/developers/intelligent-contracts/debugging

Debugging Intelligent Contracts on GenLayer involves deploying contracts, sending transactions, validating their behavior, and identifying issues using logs. Here is some guidance on how to debug using the GenLayer Studio.

## 2. Debugging in GenLayer Studio

When testing in GenLayer Studio, you can debug issues by examining the logs and outputs. The Studio provides detailed logs for every transaction and contract execution.

### Getting Static Code Syntax Errors
If you get a syntax error in your contract, you can see the error on a red panel in the Studio in the **Run and Debug** tab.

Here is an example of a syntax error in line 42 of the Wizard of Coin contract:

### Viewing Logs

#### Access Logs
The logs are located in the bottom section of the Studio in the **Run and Debug** tab.

#### Filter Relevant Logs
Use filters to isolate logs related to specific transactions or contracts. You can select the debug level (info, success, error), the execution layer (RPC Server, GenVM, and Consensus), and the transaction hash.

Also, you can select a transaction from the left list and see the logs for that specific transaction.

### Identifying Common Issues

#### Input Validation Errors
- Look for incorrect or missing parameters in the transaction payload

#### Contract Logic Errors
- Debug issues in contract logic by examining state changes and variable values in logs

#### Non-deterministic Output Issues
- Analyze LLM or web data interactions for discrepancies or timeouts

#### Consensus Errors
- Investigate validator disagreements or timeout errors to identify potential misconfigurations
