# Testing Intelligent Contracts

Source: https://docs.genlayer.com/developers/intelligent-contracts/testing

The [GenLayer Testing Suite](https://pypi.org/project/genlayer-test/) (`genlayer-test`) is a pytest-based framework for testing Intelligent Contracts. It provides two execution modes to match your workflow.

## Installation

```bash
pip install genlayer-test
```

## Two Modes at a Glance

|                   | Direct Mode                               | Studio Mode                                      |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **How it works**  | Runs contract code in-memory (no network) | Deploys to GenLayer Studio via RPC               |
| **Speed**         | Milliseconds per test                     | Minutes per test                                 |
| **Prerequisites** | Python 3.12+                              | Python 3.12+ and GenLayer Studio (Docker)        |
| **Best for**      | Unit tests, rapid iteration, CI/CD        | Integration tests, consensus validation, testnet |
| **Mocking**       | `mock_web` / `mock_llm` cheatcodes        | Mock validators with LLM/web responses           |

> **Note:**
  **Start with Direct Mode.** It runs in milliseconds, requires no Docker, and covers the vast majority of contract logic. Add Studio Mode tests only when you need multi-validator consensus or full-network behavior.

## Direct Mode

Direct Mode runs your contract Python code in-process -- no simulator, no Docker required.

### Quick Start

```python
# tests/test_storage.py

def test_storage(direct_deploy):
    # Deploy the contract in-memory
    storage = direct_deploy("contracts/Storage.py", "initial value")

    # Call view methods directly
    assert storage.get_storage() == "initial value"

    # Call write methods directly
    storage.update_storage("updated")
    assert storage.get_storage() == "updated"
```

Run with pytest:

```bash
pytest tests/ -v
```

### Fixtures

Direct Mode provides built-in pytest fixtures:

| Fixture | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `direct_vm` | VM context with cheatcodes |
| `direct_deploy` | Deploy a contract in-memory |
| `direct_alice`, `direct_bob`, `direct_charlie` | Predefined test addresses |
| `direct_owner` | Default sender address |
| `direct_accounts` | List of 10 test addresses |

### Cheatcodes

The `direct_vm` fixture exposes cheatcodes for controlling test execution:

#### Changing the Sender

```python
def test_access_control(direct_vm, direct_deploy, direct_alice, direct_bob):
    contract = direct_deploy("contracts/MyContract.py")

    # Set sender permanently
    direct_vm.sender = direct_alice
    contract.owner_action()  # Called as alice

    # Prank: temporarily change sender for a single call
    with direct_vm.prank(direct_bob):
        with direct_vm.expect_revert("Unauthorized"):
            contract.owner_action()  # Reverts -- bob is not owner
```

#### Snapshots and Revert

```python
def test_state_isolation(direct_vm, direct_deploy):
    contract = direct_deploy("contracts/Counter.py")

    snap_id = direct_vm.snapshot()
    contract.increment()
    assert contract.get_count() == 1

    direct_vm.revert(snap_id)
    assert contract.get_count() == 0  # State fully restored
```

Snapshots capture full state: storage, mocks, sender, and validators.

#### Expecting Reverts

```python
def test_insufficient_balance(direct_vm, direct_deploy, direct_alice):
    contract = direct_deploy("contracts/Token.py", direct_alice, 100)

    with direct_vm.expect_revert("Insufficient balance"):
        contract.transfer(direct_alice, 999)
```

### Mocking Web and LLM Calls

Non-deterministic calls (`gl.nondet.web`, `gl.nondet.exec_prompt`) must be mocked in Direct Mode. Use regex patterns to match URLs and prompt text.

```python
def test_price_feed(direct_vm, direct_deploy):
    # Mock a web response (regex pattern matches the URL)
    direct_vm.mock_web(
        r"api\.example\.com/price",
        {"status": 200, "body": '{"price": 42.50}'}
    )

    contract = direct_deploy("contracts/PriceFeed.py")
    contract.update_price()
    assert contract.get_price() == 4250  # Stored as integer
```

```python
def test_sentiment_analysis(direct_vm, direct_deploy):
    # Mock an LLM response (regex matches the prompt text)
    direct_vm.mock_llm(r"classify.*sentiment", "positive")

    contract = direct_deploy("contracts/Sentiment.py")
    contract.analyze("I love GenLayer!")
    assert contract.get_sentiment() == "positive"
```

> **Note:**
  Set `direct_vm.strict_mocks = True` to raise an error if any registered mock is never matched. This catches stale or misspelled patterns before they hide bugs.

### Testing Validator Consensus

Verify that your equivalence principle produces consistent results across validators:

```python
def test_consensus_agreement(direct_vm, direct_deploy):
    direct_vm.mock_llm(r".*", '{"verdict": "true"}')

    contract = direct_deploy("contracts/FactChecker.py")
    # Run as the leader -- captures the validator function internally
    contract.check_claim("The sky is blue")

    # Swap mocks to simulate a dissenting validator
    direct_vm.clear_mocks()
    direct_vm.mock_llm(r".*", '{"verdict": "false"}')
    assert direct_vm.run_validator() is False  # Validator disagrees -> undetermined
```

## Studio Mode

Studio Mode deploys your contracts to a running GenLayer Studio instance and interacts via RPC. Use it when you need:

- Multi-validator consensus with real network behavior
- Verification on `localnet` or `studionet`
- Pre-testnet integration checks

### Prerequisites

- GenLayer Studio running locally (`genlayer up`)
- Python 3.12+

### Quick Start

```python
from gltest import get_contract_factory
from gltest.assertions import tx_execution_succeeded

# `default_account` is a pre-provided pytest fixture supplied by genlayer-test for Studio Mode
def test_contract_integration(default_account):
    factory = get_contract_factory("Storage")
    contract = factory.deploy(args=["initial"])

    tx = contract.update_storage(args=["new value"]).transact()
    assert tx_execution_succeeded(tx)

    result = contract.get_storage().call()
    assert result == "new value"
```

Run with the `gltest` CLI:

```bash
gltest tests/ -v
gltest --network studionet
gltest --leader-only   # Skip consensus validation (faster)
```

For the full Studio Mode API -- mock validators, LLM/web responses, multi-network configuration -- see the [genlayer-test API Reference](/api-references/genlayer-test).

## Testing Strategy

Structure your test suite in layers:

1. **Pure storage tests first** -- verify `__init__`, view methods, and write methods that do not call `gl.nondet`. These run instantly and catch most logic bugs.

2. **Mock non-deterministic calls** -- add `mock_web` / `mock_llm` to test the full execution flow with controlled outputs. Cover both happy paths and edge cases (empty responses, unexpected LLM output, HTTP errors).

3. **Consensus tests** -- use `direct_vm.run_validator()` to confirm your equivalence principle produces agreement on typical inputs. Also verify that validators disagree on inputs designed to be ambiguous.

4. **Studio Mode last** -- run a smaller set of integration tests against `localnet` in CI to verify end-to-end behavior with real validators.

> **Note:**
  Enable `direct_vm.check_pickling = True` to catch serialization bugs early. GenLayer stores contract state by pickling Python objects -- any custom class not decorated with `@allow_storage` and `@dataclass` will fail at runtime.
