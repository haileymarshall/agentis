# Prediction Market Contract

Source: https://docs.genlayer.com/developers/intelligent-contracts/examples/prediction

The Prediction Market contract sets up a scenario to determine the outcome of a football game between two teams. The contract uses the Equivalence Principle to ensure accurate and consistent decision-making based on the game's resolution data.

## Deploying the Contract

To deploy the Prediction Market contract, you'll need to initialize the contract state correctly. This will impact how the contract will respond to the game's resolution.

1. Provide the game date and the names of the two teams. The `game_date`, `team1`, and `team2` constructor parameters are automatically detected from the code. For example, you might set `game_date` to "2024-06-05", `team1` to "Brazil", and `team2` to "Jamaica".

2. Once the game details are set, deploy the contract to make it ready to interact and resolve the game results.

## Checking the Contract State

Once the contract is deployed, its address is displayed as well as the **Read Methods** section. In this case, there are no Read Methods defined.

## Executing Transactions

To interact with the deployed contract, go to the **Write Methods** section. Here, you can call the `resolve` method to process the game's result. This triggers the contract's logic to retrieve the game's data and determine the outcome based on the Equivalence Principle criteria defined.

## Analyzing the Contract's Decisions

When the `resolve` method is executed:

- The LLM retrieves the game data from the specified URL.
- It validates the game's outcome according to the Equivalence Principle defined in the code.
- Finally, it returns a JSON response that includes the game's score and the winner.

### Handling Different Scenarios

- If the game has started but not finished, the JSON response will indicate the game is not resolved yet.
- If the game has finished, the JSON response will include the final score and the winning team.
- If the game hasn't started, the JSON response will indicate this status.
