# Inference Providers

Source: https://docs.genlayer.com/developers/intelligent-contracts/tools/genlayer-studio/providers

Validators can use various inference providers to validate transactions. You can configure those providers and add custom ones to suit your needs. When you then create a new validator in the validators page, you will be able to select those providers and the relevant models from the list.

## Accessing Providers

You can manage your providers in the **Settings** page:

## Configuring Providers

Providers have the following properties:

- **Provider:** The name of the provider. For example, `OpenAI` or `ollama`.
- **Model:** The model attached to this provider. For example, `gpt-4o` or `llama3`.
- **Plugin: (only for custom providers)** When adding a custom provider, you need to specify a plugin that implements the provider. The plugin defines what configuration is necessary for the provider.
- **Provider Config:** Related environment variables, for example API keys or endpoint URLs.
- **Default Validator Config:** This config is used as default when creating a new validator, and will then be applied when making calls to inference providers using said validator.

## Adding a new Provider

You can add a new provider by clicking the **New Config** button at the top of the providers list.

## Updating an Existing Provider

To modify your validator settings, click on any existing validator and modify the fields based on your needs.

## Deleting a Provider

To delete a provider, click on the delete button beside the provider in the list.
