# Network Configuration

Source: https://docs.genlayer.com/developers/intelligent-contracts/deploying/network-configuration

GenLayer supports multiple networks, each serving specific purposes in the development lifecycle:

## Localnet

**Purpose**: Local development and testing
- **When to use**: During development, debugging, and initial testing
- **Setup**: Requires running the GenLayer Studio locally with `genlayer init` and `genlayer up`
- **URL**: `http://localhost:4000/api` (default)
- **Benefits**:
  - Full control over validators and network configuration
  - No external dependencies
  - Fast transaction processing
  - Ability to reset database and validators
  - Built-in faucet to fund accounts with GEN (💧 button in the account selector)

### Setting up Localnet

```bash
# Initialize local network
genlayer init

# Start the local network
genlayer up
```

For complete setup instructions, examples, and video tutorials, see the [GenLayer Studio Guide](../tools/genlayer-studio).

## Studionet

**Purpose**: Hosted development environment
- **When to use**: For development without local setup requirements
- **Setup**: Accessible through [studio.genlayer.com/api](https://studio.genlayer.com)
- **Benefits**:
  - No local installation required
  - Pre-configured validators
  - Shared development environment
  - Ideal for quick prototyping
  - Built-in faucet to fund accounts with GEN (💧 button in the account selector)

> **Note:**
  Studionet is perfect for getting started quickly or when you need to share your development environment with others.

### Using Studionet

```bash
# Set network to studionet
genlayer network studionet

# Deploy to studionet
genlayer deploy --contract contracts/my_contract.py
```

## TestnetAsimov

**Purpose**: Infrastructure testing and stress testing
- **When to use**: For infrastructure stability testing, scalability testing, and stress tests
- **Setup**: Connect using network configuration
- **Benefits**:
  - Stable infrastructure testing environment
  - Scalability and stress testing
  - Shared testnet for community testing

### Using TestnetAsimov

```bash
# Set network to testnet
genlayer network testnet-asimov

# Deploy to testnet
genlayer deploy --contract contracts/my_contract.py
```

## TestnetBradbury

**Purpose**: Production-like testing environment with real AI/LLM use cases
- **When to use**: For deploying and testing intelligent contracts with real LLM models
- **Setup**: Connect using network configuration
- **Benefits**:
  - Real AI workloads using powerful LLM models
  - Production-like environment for intelligent contract testing
  - Real use cases and contracts deployed
  - Shared testnet for community testing

> **Note:**
  Testnet Bradbury configuration details will be available when the network goes live. The faucet and RPC endpoints are shared with Testnet Asimov.

### Getting Testnet Tokens

Before deploying to TestnetBradbury, you'll need testnet tokens. Use the [faucet](https://testnet-faucet.genlayer.foundation/) to get free GEN tokens.

### Using TestnetBradbury

```bash
# Set network to testnet
genlayer network testnet-bradbury

# Deploy to testnet
genlayer deploy --contract contracts/my_contract.py
```

## Network Comparison

| Feature | Localnet | Studionet | TestnetAsimov | TestnetBradbury |
|---------|----------|-----------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Setup Complexity** | Medium | None | Low | Low |
| **Control Level** | Full | Limited | Limited | Limited |
| **Persistence** | Local only | Temporary | Persistent | Persistent |
| **Collaboration** | No | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Performance** | Fast | Medium | Production-like | Production-like |
| **Best for** | Development | Prototyping | Infrastructure testing | AI/LLM testing |

## Development Workflow

We recommend following this progression:

1. **Start with Localnet**: Develop and test your contracts locally with full control
2. **Test on Studionet**: Validate contracts in a shared environment
3. **Deploy to TestnetBradbury**: Final testing in a production-like environment with real AI workloads

## Managing Network Settings

### Viewing Current Configuration

```bash
# Show all configuration
genlayer config get

# Show specific network setting
genlayer config get network
```

### Setting Networks

The GenLayer CLI allows you to set a default network that will be used for all operations unless overridden.

**Interactive Network Selection:**
```bash
# Set network interactively
genlayer network
```

This command will show you available networks and let you choose:

```
? Select a network:
❯ localnet
  studionet
  testnet-asimov
  testnet-bradbury
  custom
```

**Direct Network Selection:**
```bash
# Set specific network directly
genlayer network localnet
genlayer network studionet
genlayer network testnet-asimov
genlayer network testnet-bradbury
```

### Network Switching Workflow

```bash
# Development workflow
genlayer network localnet
genlayer deploy --contract contracts/my_contract.py

# Testing workflow
genlayer network studionet
genlayer deploy --contract contracts/my_contract.py

# Pre-production workflow
genlayer network testnet-bradbury
genlayer deploy --contract contracts/my_contract.py
```

## Network Configuration File

The CLI stores network configuration in `~/.genlayer/genlayer-config.json`:

```json
{
  "network": {
    "id": 61999,
    "name": "Genlayer Localnet",
    "rpcUrls": {
      ...
    }
  }
}
```

### Manual Configuration

If needed, you can edit the configuration file directly:

```bash
# Open config file
code ~/.genlayer/genlayer-config.json

# Or edit with any editor
nano ~/.genlayer/genlayer-config.json
```

## Next Steps

- Start deploying with [CLI Deployment](./cli-deployment)
- Set up automated deployments with [Deploy Scripts](./deploy-scripts)
