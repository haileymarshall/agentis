# Interacting with Intelligent Contracts

> This page covers syntax for internal messages (IC → IC). See [Messages](/developers/intelligent-contracts/features/messages) for the conceptual model and [Value Transfers](/developers/intelligent-contracts/features/value-transfers) for sending GEN.

## Getting Contract References

Access other contracts by their address:

```python
contract_address = Address("0x03FB09251eC05ee9Ca36c98644070B89111D4b3F")

dynamically_typed_contract = gl.get_contract_at(contract_address)

@gl.contract_interface
class GenLayerContractIface:
    class View:
        def method_name(self, a: int, b: str): ...

    class Write:
        pass

statically_typed_contract = GenLayerContractIface(contract_address)
```

Both approaches result in the same runtime value,
however the statically typed approach provides type checking and autocompletion in IDEs.

## Calling View Methods

Call read-only methods on other contracts:

```python
addr: Address = ...
other = gl.get_contract_at(addr)
result = other.view().get_token_balance()
```

## Emitting Messages

Send asynchronous messages to other contracts:

```python
other = gl.get_contract_at(addr)
other.emit(on='accepted').update_status("active")
other.emit(on='finalized').update_status("active")

# With value (recipient method must be @gl.public.write.payable)
other.emit(value=u256(100), on='finalized').deposit()
```

## Deploying New Contracts

```python
gl.deploy_contract(code=contract_code)
salt: u256 = u256(1) # not zero
child_address = gl.deploy_contract(code=contract_code, salt=salt)
```

## View vs Emit

- **`view()`** is synchronous — it reads state from another contract and returns the result immediately. The target contract's state is read as of the current block.
- **`emit()`** is asynchronous — it queues a write call that executes *after* the current transaction completes. The call is not blocking.

### Accepted vs Finalized

```python
# Fast — executes after the transaction is accepted by initial consensus
other.emit(on='accepted').do_something()

# Safe — waits until the transaction is fully finalized (after appeal window)
other.emit(on='finalized').do_something()
```

**`on='accepted'` has important implications.** If the emitting transaction is appealed, two things can happen:

1. The appeal changes the contract state such that the message should not have been emitted — but it was already sent and cannot be recalled.
2. The transaction is re-executed during the appeal, and the message (or a similar one) is emitted again. This can repeat across multiple appeal rounds — up to ~6 times depending on the validator set size.

The receiving contract must be **idempotent** — it must handle duplicate or unexpected messages gracefully. If the receiving logic cannot tolerate duplicates or messages that "shouldn't have been sent" based on the final state, use `on='finalized'` instead.

## Factory Pattern

Deploy child contracts from a parent:

```python
def __init__(self, num_workers: int):
    with open("/contract/Worker.py", "rt") as f:
        worker_code = f.read()

    for i in range(num_workers):
        addr = gl.deploy_contract(
            code=worker_code.encode("utf-8"),
            args=[i, gl.message.contract_address],
            salt_nonce=i + 1,
            on="accepted",
        )
        self.worker_addresses.append(addr)
```

Child contracts are immutable after deployment. To update worker logic, redeploy through the factory.
